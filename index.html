                <h2>C++</h2>
                <p>
                    Started using it while learning to create a game engine, learned the basic and advance concepts<br>
                    from various YouTubers like "CodeBeauty", "The Cherno" and reading documentation.<br>
                    I also learned a lot from <a>learnopenGL.com</a> when i was curious about graphics programming<br>
                    I have experience using CMake, Make, Ninja and Clang to build most projects<br>
                </p>

                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p>
                    Created games during high school using the Unity Game Engine<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Bash</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned it during the time when i was fed up with Windows 10 and switched to GNU/Linux.<br>
                    At first i chose Arch Linux as my main OS, after finally installing it successfully i ran into<br>
                    various issues with device drivers so i learned bash and created various bash scripts to fix issues<br>
                    that constantly come back with each reboot after a few distro hops i landed on Linux Mint and haven't changed<br>                
                </p>

                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned it at Tshwane University of Technology(TUT), it felt a lot like C# and a bit of C++ but wasn't as hard<br>
                    as learning C++, haven't really done anything with it besides University tests and Exam, got mostly distinctions too.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>
                    My first project with it is this portfolio site, I watched a video or two for quick basics and started building the site<br>

                <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy making art in my spare time, most of the art on this site was hand drawn by me with my Huion drawing tablet<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Exploring Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    I like exploring other sides of technology that I have yet to touch, I buy all sorts of tech and if its not locked down<br>
                    I'll tinker with it if I find it interesting<br>
